# Pagination Example in React

This is a simple React application demonstrating how to implement **pagination** using functional components and hooks. The app fetches a list of items (products) from a mock API and enables users to navigate through paginated data. It is designed to be a lightweight and reusable example of handling pagination in React applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Fetches paginated items (products) from a mock API.
- **State Management with Hooks**: Uses the `useState` hook to manage:
  - **Current Page**: Tracks the active page number.
  - **Total Pages**: Dynamically calculates the total number of pages.
  - **Products**: Manages the list of products to display on the current page.
- **Reusable Pagination Logic**: Built for scalability and reusability across applications.

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prosaquib/frontend-machine-coding.git
   cd react-pagination-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

- Add filters and sorting options for products.
- Integrate a real API for fetching products.
- Add tests for components and hooks.
- Improve accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation for pagination controls).
